# NeuroPulse: Edge-AI Seizure Detection 

##  Project Overview
NeuroPulse is a high-performance, low-power seizure detection engine designed for real-time edge processing on FPGA. Developed by **Team AntiGravity**, this system implements an optimized 1D-CNN architecture specialized for the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG dataset. Our implementation focuses on achieving ultra-low latency and minimal resource consumption for next-generation wearable medical devices.
